    <p>Doraemon (Japanese: ドラえもん) is a fictional character in the Japanese manga and anime series of the same name created by Fujiko F. Fujio. Doraemon is a male robotic earless cat that travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a preteen boy named Nobita. An official birth certificate for the character gives him a birth date of 3 September 2112 and lists his city of residency as Kawasaki, Kanagawa, the city where the manga was created.[6] In 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed Doraemon the country's "anime ambassador".</p>

    <p>Suneo Honekawa (骨川 スネ夫, Honekawa Suneo) is the fox-faced (inherited from his mother) rich child who loves to flaunt his material wealth before everyone, especially Nobita. A lot of the stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game, toy or pet which evokes Nobita's envy.Suneo is a wealthy and spoiled boy who uses his friendship with Gian to win the respect of other schoolmates. Shizuka is a gentle and kind girl who frequently plays with Nobita. Nobita has a crush on Shizuka; she is his prospective future wife (Nobita's future wife is initially Gian's younger sister).</p>

    <p>Takeshi Goda (剛田 武, Gōda Takeshi) usually known by the nickname "Gian" (「ジャイアン」, "Jaian", English: Big G) is a strong and quick-tempered local bully. He frequently steals other children's stuff (especially Nobita's and Suneo's) under the pretext of "borrowing" them, unless the toy is damaged.He is recognized by his large build (might partly be contributed by obesity) as well as his mean and aggressive behavior. He "rules" the neighborhood with force, often at the physical expense of other children, especially Nobita, who often resorts to asking Doraemon for gadgets to get even on him. He appears to be just as dependent on Nobita as Nobita is on Doraemon as he constantly tells him what to do despite Nobita's protests. In addition, he has a tendency to steal or rob others, usually Suneo, who offers to be Gian's sidekick on most occasions.</p>
